Problem: Assignment utilizing the GIPHY API, Javascript, jQuery, Boostrap, and HTML. Create a page where when one of the buttons at the top is clicked 10 random gifs appear on the page. When clicking on the gifs they should animage; clicking the gif again will make the animation stop. The user should be able to type and word in the search bar and this will add a gif button for that word and then display the 10 random gifs from that word.

Solution: Created a GIPHY token, used an AJAX function to call the GIPHY site based upon a search query URL that includes the search term, the number of images to display, and the raing. Created an on click function to call the AJAX function for each of the search buttons. Created an on click function to add the button from the user's search.
